# wine_variety

In this project we have used the train.csv file to train our SVM model. We have used 'review-description' parameter for this purpose. We have preprocessed the descriptions using TFIDF and prepared the unigrams and bigrams for each of the 28 wine varieties and using these unigrams and bigrams we have trained the Support Vector Machine.

The training has taken around 24 hours due to the vastness of the train.csv dataset.
